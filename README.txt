Clutch: Lehigh University Chatbot
Clutch, Lehigh's mascot, is now an innovative chatbot designed specifically for incoming Lehigh students. The chatbot is well-versed in Lehigh's campus and will provide tips and give websites from the school. The bot can also engage in basic conversation but is meant to answer questions about the school.

Things to ask Clutch the Lehigh University Chatbot:
This is a list of things to ask the chatbot, but the questions entered can vary and still give the same result. Try these questions as well as any other questions you may have. All of these test cases have been tested and are working.
- How are you?
- What is the weather like there?
Have any food suggestions?
- How to stay healthy as a college student?
- Who are you?
- What time is the campus open?
- What programs are offered?
- What are fees?
- Where is the campus located?
- Who is the campus president?
- What are scholarships?

The file can be run natively if all Python extensions are installed including: nltk, tensorflow, flask, and numpy. Tensorflow will only work natively on Windows computers. The project can be run by running the flaskapp.py program. The chatbot.py program offers the same chatbot but without the HTML interface.
